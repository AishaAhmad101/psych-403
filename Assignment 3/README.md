This is my set of answers to the assignment
Variables exercise
Yes, varibles show up on the variable editor 
No, there is no problem with two variables having the same character 
No, changing aX did not change the value of the other variables
Yes, changing the variable assignment changed 'A' to 'z'. Therefore, python variable assignment can change based on how it's defined
Operation Exercise:
1. Python does output the same values for (5/2) and (5.0/2.0)
2. The modulo operator returns the remainder of the division of 2 numbers.
3. The ** operator raises the number before the ** operator to the exponent that is after the ** operator. The // operator divides the two numbers and then floors the result
4. Python does follow order of operations

Boolean Exercise:
1. 1 and 1.0 are equivalent because they both equal 1. "1" and "1.0" are not equal because they are strings and since the second string has ".0" in it it is not the same as the first
2. 5 and (3+2) are equal because they both equal out to 5
3. 1 == 1.0 and not "1" == "1.0" and 5 == (3+2)
   1 == 1.0 or "1" == "1.0" and 5 == (3+2)
   1 == 1.0 or "1" == "1.0" or 5 == (3+2)
   1 == 1.0 and not "1" == "1.0" or 5 == (3+2)
   1 == 1.0 and not "1" == "1.0" or not 5 == (3+2)
   
List Exercise:
1. Oddlist is a variable
2. The len function says the list is 5 integers long
3. The type of oddlist is List
4. The print function prints all the integers between 0-100

Dictionary Exercise:
1. Python determines the length of a dictionary by counting the number of keys

Array Exercise:
1. The array prints in the same order that it was defined
2. The array contains 2 integers, 2 floats and 2 strings. The array keeps the original type of the items in the array.
