This is my set of answers to the assignment

Variables operations exercise
1. We need to add the string form of subnr to sub. You can't add int to a string and that's why int form subnr doesn't work 
2. (sub_code, subnr_str)
(sub_code, subnr_str*3)
((sub_code + subnr_str)*3)
(sub_code*3+subnr_str*3)

list operations exercises 
1. (numlist*2)
2. (numarr*2) when you multiple a list you double, you repeat all the numbers in the list. When you multiple an array you multiple all the items in the array 
3. ([x*2 for x in strlist])
4. (strlist*2)
